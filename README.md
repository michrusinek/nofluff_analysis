# nofluff_analysis

This is a python project where I scraped nofluffjobs website to gather and analyse data about job offers, that were connected with data analysis.
In order to do that, I scraped the website by looking at the results of searching job offers based on three different search queries: 'data analyst', 'data engineer' and 'data scientist'.
